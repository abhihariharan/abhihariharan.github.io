        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a freshman in Columbia University (CC'22), with a tentative major in Economics-Political Science. I'm from South River, New Jersey, and have a profound interest in constitutional and international law. I worked as a Research Assistant at Columbia Business School from Sept-December 2018 and am currently an Online Writer for the Columbia Undergraduate Law Review (CULR). In my spare time, I like to follow up on politics and elections, read up on history, binge watch shows on Netflix, and meet new people. In the future, I hope to go to law school and make a difference in my community.</p>
